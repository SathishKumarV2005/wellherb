                Back pain has been documented since ancient times, with early references found in Egyptian, Greek, and Chinese medical texts. The condition was often linked to physical labor, aging, and poor posture. Ancient healers used massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to treat back pain. Over time, advancements in medical science identified causes such as spinal degeneration, muscle strain, and nerve compression. Modern lifestyles, including prolonged sitting and lack of physical activity, have increased the prevalence of back pain worldwide.Back pain can affect people of all ages but is more common in adults and the elderly. Young adults may experience back pain due to poor posture, sports injuries, or heavy lifting. Middle-aged individuals often develop back pain due to muscle strain, herniated discs, or sedentary lifestyles. Elderly people are more prone to degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, and osteoporosis. Pregnant women frequently experience lower back pain due to weight gain and changes in posture. People with physically demanding jobs or those who sit for extended periods are also at higher risk.Back pain occurs due to several factors that affect the muscles, nerves, or spine. Muscle or ligament strain from heavy lifting, sudden movements, or poor posture is a common cause. Herniated or bulging discs can compress nerves, leading to pain and discomfort. Degenerative conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis weaken the spine and contribute to chronic pain. Injuries from falls, accidents, or sports activities may lead to fractures or spinal misalignment. Sedentary lifestyles and obesity increase pressure on the spine, leading to pain and stiffness. Psychological factors such as stress and anxiety can cause muscle tension, worsening back pain. Infections, tumors, or inflammatory diseases like ankylosing spondylitis can also lead to persistent back pain.
